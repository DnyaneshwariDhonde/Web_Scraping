# Web_Scraping

Complete and submit my Web Scraping project for the Prodigy Infotech Internship! 🌐💻

This Python script scrapes product information (Name, Price, and Rating) from Amazon’s search results page for "laptops". It utilizes the requests library to fetch webpage content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. Extracted data is then saved into a CSV file using pandas, ensuring structured storage. The script also includes error handling to skip products with missing details.

This project enhanced my skills in web scraping, data extraction, and automation, helping me understand how to efficiently collect and manage online data.
